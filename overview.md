# Overview

This is a copy of the *chapter-template.md* file with a few changes.

## Here is a sub-section

Now we go into details.

There might be some example command-line usage with accompanying shell output.
This is an example of such output:

```shell
// This is a comment
$ some-command
Some Output
...

// Commands issued by normal users have a prompt that starts with a '$' sign,
// and they are coloured green:
$ whoami
myname
$ sudo /bin/bash
[sudo] password for myname: 

// Now the user becomes root, so the prompt ('#') and the colour ('red') change:
# whoami
root
```

### Here is a sub-sub-section

Hello World!

## Here is another sub-section

etc.

# Overview

Documenting with the [Markdown language][md] is wonderfully simple and clean.
When combined with the capabilities of the [Pandoc][pandoc] command set then
many options exist for generating elegant documents from a markdown document.

The tools provided with this guide provide generated *html* and *pdf* output.
[Other formats][pandoc-formats] are possible; including:

   * docx (Microsoft Word)
   * rtf (Rich Text Format)
   * odt (OpenOffice writer)

These tools focus on writing complex computer technical documentation, but 
they can easily be adapted to other purposes, like writing presentation
slides, or scientific latex documents.  By modifying style and template
parameters you can adapt the tools to your needs.

The platform used for this project is Ubuntu LTS 22.04 on a Raspberry Pi, as
documented at \
 [https://github.com/deatrich/linux-home-server][linservproj]

The version of Pandoc used is 2.9.  However any other system with a recent
installation of *Pandoc* should work as well.

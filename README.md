# Getting Started With Pandoc Markdown

While writing a guide about creating a [Linux Home Server][home-server] using
Pandoc markdown I spent some time understanding issues and finding solutions.
For future markdown-based guides I want to reuse the setup files I created.
Thus I created this repository with all the setup files needed to easily 
begin writing guides and generating both HTML and PDF output files.

This guide was necessarily written using the Markdown markup language.  As the
flavour of Markdown used is the Pandoc flavour, then some features in
the document (like definition lists) may not render correctly in the
Github flavour.  Nevertheless, you can still 
[browse markdown files in GitHub][mygithub.com].

Recent [Pandoc-generated HTML and PDF files][mygithub.io] will be available
on my github.io site -- they are not there yet.

This is a work in progress; here is the preliminary task list.

## Preliminary task list for main document
- [x] Copy and modify initial support files from *linux-home-server* project
- [ ] Complete an 'overview' chapter 
- [x] Describe all support files and complete the 'setup-files' chapter
- [ ] Document the client software installation
- [ ] Complete the 'create-workspace' chapter
- [ ] Document editor setup and issues
- [ ] Complete 'editor-issues' chapter
- [ ] Add additional topics like spell-checking
- [ ] Write a chapter on using Pandoc with markdown examples
